# 🚀 CI/CD Concepts & Deployment Best Practices in Databricks

---

## 📘 1. CI/CD Concepts in the Databricks Context

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is essential for delivering reliable, testable, and repeatable machine learning and data engineering workflows. In the Databricks ecosystem, CI/CD supports the lifecycle of notebooks, jobs, workflows, models, and infrastructure.

### 🔹 What is CI/CD in Databricks?

* **CI (Continuous Integration):** Automating testing and validation of code changes, typically using GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, GitLab CI, or Jenkins.
* **CD (Continuous Deployment):** Automatically deploying validated changes into different Databricks environments (Dev → Test → Prod).

Git Repo (e.g., GitHub)
   |
   |--- Pull Request --> Run Tests (CI)
   |                           |
   |<-- Feedback / Failures <--|
   |
   |--- Merge to Main Branch

### ⚙️ CI/CD Components in Databricks

| Component                | Description                                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Notebooks / Code**     | Stored in Git or Workspace                        |
| **Databricks Repos**     | Git-backed notebook folders                       |
| **Jobs & Workflows**     | Trigger ETL, ML, or data validation pipelines     |
| **Libraries**            | Custom Python/Scala packages (e.g., `.whl` files) |
| **Secrets**              | Managed via Databricks Secrets CLI                |
| **Clusters / Workflows** | Managed via Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)          |

### 🚧 Common CI/CD Tools with Databricks

| Tool                           | Role in CI/CD                                    |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **GitHub Actions / GitLab CI** | Orchestrate CI/CD pipelines                      |
| **Terraform**                  | Provision Databricks resources (clusters, jobs)  |
| **Databricks CLI**             | Automate deployment (jobs, notebooks, secrets)   |
| **MLflow**                     | Manage model versioning and deployment           |
| **dbx** (Databricks Labs)      | Advanced packaging, testing, and deployment tool |

---

### ✅ CI/CD Workflow Example

1. **Code Commit → Git**
2. **Unit Tests & Linting → CI Pipeline**
3. **Build Artifacts (e.g., Wheel files for ML)**
4. **Deploy to Dev/Staging using `databricks-cli` or `dbx`**
5. **Integration Tests in Databricks Jobs**
6. **Promote to Production**

## 📘 2. Overview of Deployment Best Practices

Effective deployment in Databricks ensures **automation, reproducibility, security, and reliability** across data platforms.

---

### 🧭 Environment Strategy

Use clearly separated environments:

| Environment      | Purpose                               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Dev**          | Experimentation, notebook development |
| **Staging/Test** | Integration testing, UAT              |
| **Prod**         | Final pipelines and ML model serving  |

Use **workspace naming conventions** or **separate Databricks workspaces**.

---

### 🔐 Secrets & Credentials

* Use **Databricks Secrets** to store API keys, credentials, and tokens.
* Avoid hardcoding secrets in notebooks.
* Use environment-specific scopes (`dev-scope`, `prod-scope`).

---

### 📦 Code & Package Management

* Use **Databricks Repos** for source control integration (GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps).
* Use **Python wheels (`.whl`) or libraries** for reusable logic.
* Apply **branching strategy** (e.g., `main`, `develop`, `feature/*`).

---

### ⚙️ Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)

* Use **Terraform (Databricks Provider)** to:

  * Create clusters
  * Set up jobs, repos, secrets, ACLs
* Keep infrastructure versioned and deployable.

---

### 📈 Testing Best Practices

| Test Type          | Tooling                 |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| **Unit Tests**     | `pytest`, `unittest`    |
| **Notebook Tests** | `dbx`, Databricks %run  |
| **Integration**    | Staging pipelines       |
| **Model Testing**  | MLflow model validation |

---

### 🧪 Deployment Validation

* Use **dry-run mode** before applying changes.
* Run **automated validation tests** after deployment.
* Set up **monitoring & alerting** for jobs and workflows.

---

### 🔄 Model Deployment (if applicable)

* Use **MLflow** for tracking, packaging, and promoting models.
* Use **Model Registry** for staging → production promotion.
* Enable **CI/CD checks** (e.g., canary testing, shadow mode) if deploying models to real-time endpoints.
