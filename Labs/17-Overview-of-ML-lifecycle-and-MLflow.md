# **ML Lifecycle & MLflow**

## **1. Machine Learning Lifecycle Overview**

The ML lifecycle is a structured framework for developing, deploying, and maintaining machine learning models. It consists of six key phases:

### **1.1 Problem Definition**
- Business objective identification
- Success metric determination (e.g., accuracy, ROI)
- Data availability assessment

### **1.2 Data Preparation**
- Data collection and labeling
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Dataset splitting (train/validation/test)

### **1.3 Model Development**
- Algorithm selection
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model training
- Validation and benchmarking

### **1.4 Model Evaluation**
- Performance metric calculation
- Business metric validation
- Bias/fairness testing
- Model interpretability analysis

### **1.5 Deployment**
- Model packaging
- API/service creation
- A/B testing framework
- Monitoring integration

### **1.6 Monitoring & Maintenance**
- Performance drift detection
- Data drift monitoring
- Model retraining strategy
- Version management

## **2. MLflow: The Machine Learning Platform**

MLflow is an open-source platform for managing the ML lifecycle, with four core components:

### **2.1 MLflow Tracking**
- **Purpose**: Record and query experiments
- **Key Features**:
  - Parameter and metric logging
  - Artifact storage (models, plots)
  - Visual comparison of runs
  - Environment capture

### **2.2 MLflow Projects**
- **Purpose**: Packaging ML code for reuse
- **Key Features**:
  - Standardized format
  - Dependency specification
  - Entry point definitions
  - Git integration

### **2.3 MLflow Models**
- **Purpose**: Model packaging and deployment
- **Key Features**:
  - Standard packaging format
  - Multiple deployment options (REST, batch)
  - Model signatures (input/output schema)
  - PyFunc interface for custom logic

### **2.4 MLflow Model Registry**
- **Purpose**: Centralized model management
- **Key Features**:
  - Version control
  - Stage transitions (Staging → Production)
  - Annotations and descriptions
  - Webhooks for CI/CD

## **3. MLflow in the ML Lifecycle**

| ML Phase       | MLflow Component       | Key Benefits                          |
|----------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Development    | Tracking               | Reproducibility, experiment comparison |
| Packaging      | Projects               | Reusable, shareable code              |
| Deployment     | Models                 | Consistent serving interface          |
| Production     | Model Registry         | Governance, audit trail               |
| Monitoring    | Tracking + Registry    | Performance history, rollback capability |

## **4. Key Advantages of MLflow**

1. **Open-Source**: Free to use with no vendor lock-in
2. **Framework-Agnostic**: Works with any ML library
3. **Language Support**: Python, R, Java, REST APIs
4. **Platform Flexibility**: Runs anywhere (local, cloud, hybrid)
5. **Extensible**: Custom plugins and integrations

## **5. Common Use Cases**

1. **Experiment Management**: Track hundreds of model variations
2. **Model Deployment**: Serve models as REST APIs with minimal code
3. **Collaboration**: Share experiments across data science teams
4. **Governance**: Maintain audit trails for compliance
5. **CI/CD Integration**: Automate model testing and deployment
